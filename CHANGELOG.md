# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-09-24
- Added comprehensive JSON path normalization so dot/bracket notation, array indices, quoted keys, and root-level selectors generate valid `JSON_VALUE` expressions.
- Hardened SQL escaping for search and `where` values that contain quotes or backslashes.
- Expanded integration coverage for nested selections, array indexes, complex keys, and structured-object comparisons.
- Documented the JSON path syntax in the README and published the CLI update.
